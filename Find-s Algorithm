step1:-  Initialize h to the most specific hypothesis H
step2:-  For each positive training instance x
         a. For each attribute constraint ai in h 
		            If the constraint ai is satisfied by x
		            Then do nothing
		            Else replace ai in h by the next more general constraint that is satisfied by x 
step3:-  Output hypothesis h
